## Welcome, Python newbies!

We welcome all levels of questions about anything Python-related at all our meetups, meetup.com comment boxes, and (in the future) mailing list threads. Please don't be shy about this kind of thing.

However if you're learning Python from scratch, with or without previous programming experience, there are lots of great online resources to get you started.  

### Tutorials

* [Beginner's Guide to Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide) on the official Python Wiki is an excellent place to start.

* [Dive Into Python 3](http://www.diveintopython3.net/) is an online book which is gaining some notoriety.  Avaiable in pdf, html, or the flattened processed remains of pulverized tree corpses.


### Local Groups

* Charleston Python (you're here now)

* [Charleston Data Analytics](https://www.meetup.com/Charleston-Data-Analytics/) frequently has talks from local tech experts -- worth checking out even if it isn't Python-specific.

* [Iron Yard Charleston](https://www.theironyard.com/charleston) offers programming classes downtown, and hosts our meetups occasionally.

* [Charleston Women In Tech](https://www.meetup.com/Charleston-Women-In-Tech/)


### Online Communities

* Python subreddits include [/r/python](http://reddit.com/r/python) for general discussion and news, and [/r/learnpython](http://reddit.com/r/learnpython) for questions and more resources.

* Check out the [Python mailing lists](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo).
