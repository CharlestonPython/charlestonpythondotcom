## Welcome, Python newbies!

We welcome all levels of questions about anything Python-related at all our meetups, meetup.com comment boxes, and (in the future) mailing list threads. Please don't be shy about this kind of thing.

However if you're learning Python from scratch, with or without previous programming experience, there are lots of great online resources to get you started.  

### Tutorials and Help pages

* [General Python FAQ](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html), straight from the Python documentation.

* [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html#tutorial-index), also from the Python docs.

* [Beginner's Guide to Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide) on the official Python Wiki is an excellent place to start.

* [Hitchhiker's Guide To Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/), a best practice handbook for novice and expert Python developers.

* [Dive Into Python 3](http://www.diveintopython3.net/) is an online book which is gaining some notoriety.  Available in pdf, html, or the flattened processed remains of pulverized tree corpses.

* [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) is a free e-book introduction to Python, with a focus on practical application.
