Please join us for an evening of Python programming!  Goals for this meeting:

(1) Figure out what you all want out of this group in the upcoming year.

(2) Chris will give a quick talk about one or more standard library modules he thinks are useful.  If y'all like this it can be a recurring thing and I can call it "Module of the Month" perhaps.

(3) Jonathan will talk about an application he's been working on. (Jonathan can insert details here if he wants to :)

(4) TJ will talk about TinyDB a pure python file based database alternative to SQLite.

(5) [Lightning talks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk) if anyone wants to give them [1].  These are fun, informal 5-10 minute talks about something you're working on, and they don't have to be scheduled.  Tell us what you're working on!
