    print("Hello Charleston pythonistas!")

We are a group of ~150 Python users and enthusiasts in the greater Charleston area.  This website is going to be a running log of all meetings and information regarding the Charleston Python usergroup.

If you're a professional programmer, hobbyist, or just interested in learning the Python language, please join us at one of our meetings! Meetings are organized at meetup.com (see the link in the sidebar).  If you're totally new to Python, consider checking out the Resources page at the top, and flipping through some of those links.

Right now the group is trying to meet approximately once a month. We're a relatively new group to the area, so if you have any ideas about what would be awesome, let someone know!

This page is maintained by Chris, feel free to email if you have any questions or suggestions, or if you want to put something up on here. You can reach me at christopher.r.mullins at gmail.
